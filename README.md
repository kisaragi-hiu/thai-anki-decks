# Thai Anki decks

Anki decks I made for myself while learning Thai.

Relies on [npm:anki-apkg-export](https://www.npmjs.com/package/anki-apkg-export).

## Why yaml

Having a YAML source file helps me edit more comfortably within my editor. The alternative is gradually defining decks within Anki or relying on CSV, which I didn't want to take as an option.
